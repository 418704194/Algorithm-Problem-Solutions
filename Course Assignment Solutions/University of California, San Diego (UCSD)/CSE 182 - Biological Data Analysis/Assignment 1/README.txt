|datafile.txt -------------> The provided example FASTA file                   |
|Filter.java  -------------> Extract only mouse/rat sequences from given FASTA |
|GetSeq.java --------------> Find a query sequence's GI number (after CreateDB)|
|HelloBioinformatics.java -> A basic program to print "Hello Bioinformatics"   |

1) I subscribed to the Google Group today.

2) I chose to use Java for the assignment. The program that outputs
   "Hello Bioinformatics" is called "HelloBioinformatics.java".
   
   -TO COMPILE: javac HelloBioinformatics.java
   -TO RUN:     java HelloBioinformatics

3) The program that reads each line of FASTA and dumps the header line of each
   sequence in the database followed by the length of that sequence is called
   "Cat.java".
   
   -TO COMPILE:    javac Cat.java
   -TO RUN:        java Cat fasta_file
   -OUTPUT FORMAT: Each header will be printed, and below it will be its length

4) The program that extracts mouse/rat headers+sequences from a given FASTA file
   is called "Filter.java". The program outputs in the FASTA format (with a
   maximum of 60 characters per sequence line).
   
   -TO COMPILE: javac Filter.java
   -TO RUN:     java Filter fasta_file

5) The program that performs the Database Index Creation is called
   "CreateDB.java". When run, it will generate two files: data.seq and data.in.
   
   -TO COMPILE: javac CreateDB.java
   -TO RUN:     java CreateDB fasta_file

6) The program that reads the index files "data.seq" and "data.in" is called
   "GetSeq.java". The program takes as argument a query sequence and outputs
   the GI number of the database sequence containing the query.
   I included both "data.seq" and "data.in", but they can be regenerated by
   running CreateDB (see Step 5).
   
   -TO COMPILE: javac GetSeq.java
   -TO RUN:     java GetSeq query_sequence
   
   When I use MHIQITDFGTAKVLSPDS as the query, the GI returned is 18202068.

7) I spent 3 hours on this assignment.
   I referred to Google for help with removing whitespace from a string and with
   splitting a string into equal parts. I also referred to the Java API.
