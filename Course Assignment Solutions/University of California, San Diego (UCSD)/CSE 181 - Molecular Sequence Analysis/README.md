# CSE 181: Molecular Sequence Analysis #

### Description
---
This folder contains my solutions to the problems assigned in the UCSD course CSE 181: Molecular Sequence Analysis, taught by [Dr. Pavel Pevzner](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ppevzner/).

The assigned problems were from ROSALIND, so the solutions in this folder align with the solutions in the "[ROSALIND Solutions](https://github.com/niemasd/Algorithm-Problem-Solutions/tree/master/ROSALIND%20Solutions)" folder.

### Folder Structure
---

Naming Convention:
* __##__ - __???__
 * __##__ = Problem number (problems were assigned in increasing numerical order)
 * __???__ = Official name of the problem

Each problem's folder contains 2 files:
* .java or .py file (the problem's solution)
* README.jpg (the ROSALIND instructions for the problem)
