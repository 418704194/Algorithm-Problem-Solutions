PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
    The program (ResizableBall) is an applet that, on a canvas specified, draws
 a ball that grows to two times its original diameter, then shrinks back to its
 original diameter, then grows, etc. The canvas starts blank, with just axes on
 it (x and y). When the canvas is clicked on, a ResizableBall is drawn centered
 at the click. Depending on the quadrant that the ResizableBall is centered in,
 it is a defined color. When clicked on, the axes can be moved. If this changes
 the quadrant that a ball is now in, its color is updated to be correct. 

  USAGE: appletviewer ResizableBallController.html
         (or just view ResizableBallController.html in a web browser)

  On Start:   Show axes (one horizontal and one vertical line)

  On Click:   Draw a ResizableBalle centered at the mouse click
              If one or both axes is clicked on, consider it "grabbed"

  On Drag:    If axis/axes is grabbed and mouse is still pressed, move axis/
              axes with the mouse

  On Release: If axis/axes was grabbed, now consider it released

SHORT RESPONSE QUESTIONS
 1. From my current directory, to copy over fubar.java from a folder three
    directories above, I would use the following comand:
      cp ../../../foobar.java .

 2. For more information about a Unix command, add --help after the command.
    For example:
      cat --help

 3. From the current directory, to remove all .html files in Home, I would use
    the following command:
      rm ~/*.html

 4. In vim, :q doesn't allow you to close the file if it hasn't been saved
    since the last edit, while :q! overrides this safety check.

 5. 1) A constructor has no return type (not even void).
         Normal Method: public void Name(); Constructor: public Name();
    2) Constructors share the name of the class.
         Because of this, constructor names are usually nouns, while normal
         method names are usually actions (verbs).
           E.g. Constructor:   FallingBalls() (a noun)
                Normal Method: setColor()     (a verb)

 6. Overloading is when two methods in a class have the same name but have
    different parameters.
      E.g. public static int findMax(int a, int b)
           public static double findMax(double a, double b)
      Both can be in a class and it will work fine. If findMax(2,3) is run,
      findMax(int a, int b) will be called. If findMax(2.0, 3.0) is run,
      findMax(double a, double b) will be called.
