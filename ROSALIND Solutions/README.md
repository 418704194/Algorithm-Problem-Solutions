### What is ROSALIND?
Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving. [Take a tour](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-textbook-track) to get the hang of how Rosalind works.

### What is in this repository?
I have been putting my solutions to ROSALIND problems into this GitHub repository. The majority of my solutions are in Java (my personal language of choice), and a few are in Python. Feel free to check them out and compare with your own!
