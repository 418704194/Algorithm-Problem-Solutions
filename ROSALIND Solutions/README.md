# Niema's ROSALIND Solutions #

### Description
---
This folder contains my solutions to bioinformatics problems on the ROSALIND website. The majority of my solutions are in Java, but a few are in Python.

### What is ROSALIND?
---
Description (from ROSALIND website):

Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving. [Take a tour](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-textbook-track) to get the hang of how Rosalind works.

### Folder Structure
---
The ROSALIND solutions are organized into five folders, mirroring the ROSALIND website. The categories are (in alphabetical order):
* Algorithmic Heights
* Bioinformatics Armory (COMPLETED)
* Bioinformatics Stronghold
* Bioinformatics Textbook Track (COMPLETED)
* Python Village (COMPLETED)

In each folder (with the exception of "Python Village"), each problem has its own folder, named as follows:
* __##__ - __ABCD__ - __???__
 * __##__ = How many I solved (e.g. 10 would mean that this is my 10th problem solved)
 * __ABCD__ = ROSALIND's problem ID (each problem on ROSALIND has a unique 3-4 character ID)
 * __???__ = Official name of the problem

Each problem's folder contains 2 files:
* .java or .py file (the problem's solution)
* README.jpg (the ROSALIND instructions for the problem)
